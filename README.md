# Color-detection-using-ARM-CORTEX-M01-

Using Keil software I have given the instructions to the microprocessor throught Embedde C++ code to detect the
color of object using TCS3200 color sensor and display the result (color of object ) on the screen of the
computer through serial communication(PUTTY).

The FRDM board KL25Z (ARM Cortex M0+) is used and the microprocessor program developed in Embedded C++
