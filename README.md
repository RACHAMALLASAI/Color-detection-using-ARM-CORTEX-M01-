# Color-detection-using-ARM-CORTEX-M01-

Using Keil software I have given the instructions to the microprocessor throught C code to detect the
color of object using TCS3200 color sensor and display the result (color of object )on the screen of the
computer through serial communication(PUTTY).

I have learned about how to configure microprocessor ARM CORTEX MO1+ .
